---Project Name---
Flashcards

---Description--
This program is meant to act as a Flashcards for learning. 
The code works in a way that given a sentence, example:

Pie - Essential for a happy life.

'Pie' displayed on the front of the card. 'Essential for a happy life' on the
back of the card.

NOTE! The program is intended to work on a .docx file.
Given the path of the .docx file the program will create cards for each block of code
in the text file.

The program uses blank spaces to distinguish between text blocks.

The character '-' is used to divide each block into two parts.

The GUI has three buttons. 

Flip: Flips the card so either the back or the front is displayed.

Yes: If you can match the information displayed on the back of the card correctly
this button will remove the card from the deck and place it in a deck with only
completed cards.

No: If you fail to match the information displayed on the back of the card this button
will place the card back into the deck and shuffle it.

---Additional information---
The reason why I have chosen to use .docx in my program is because I want to be able
to use my lecture notes. The notes are created in 'Word'. One could argue that the same result could be achieved by converting the .docx file to a raw text file. But hey, it works!
